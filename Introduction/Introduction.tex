\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

I did my thesis in \R{}, and it took me a while to get everything working the way I wanted. The example here is a skeleton that could serve as a starting point to write not only theses, but any kind of document using \LaTeX{} and \R{}.

The main files have a \texttt{Rnw} extension and are transformed into \texttt{tex} files by using the \texttt{knitr} package.\footnote{\url{http://yihui.name/knitr/}} However, anything that doesn't depend on \R{} can be written directly in \texttt{tex} files, making it flexible.

I didn't put too much effort into the layout shown here, it is only meant to serve as a starting point with some examples. Other templates can also be used.
